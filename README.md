# Password-Generator
Javascript Password generator

Here is my attempt at a Random Password Generator. I used an index.html file to create the layout, styled it with CSS and used a script.js file for the functions. I created variables for all special characters, numbers and upper and lower case letters. I also created prompts for the user to select how long they would like their desired password and whether they want all characters in their password. 

To determine the characters in the password I used 'If' statements so that if the user entered 'y' then the password would include the specified characters. To generate the actual password I used a function with a for loop.
