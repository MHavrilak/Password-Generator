# Password-Generator
Javascript Password generator

This is my attempt at a Random Password Generator. I used an index.html file to create the layout and styled it with CSS and Bootstrap. My javascript is where I need more attention. I created variables for all special characters, numbers and upper and lower case letters. I also created prompts for the user to select whether they want all characters in their password. I attempted a While loop so that the user has to pick a password between 8-128 characters long, however it is not working properly. I also attempted to create a for loop for my password generator. I feel like I am missing a few pieces of code before I can make it functional.
